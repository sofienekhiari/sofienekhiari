I'm a driven pharmacist currently pursuing a MSc degree in Drug Sciences at the University of Basel and involved in captivating projects with the Computational Pharmacy Group, where I can blend my love for the fascinating fields of Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Computer Sciences.

As a staunch advocate of Open Source Software and Open Science, I'm committed to contributing to the community and fostering a spirit of collaboration. I curate a collection of short articles in which I share intriguing tips, tricks, and news related to the field of Computer Science, with a special focus on Computational Pharmacy.

Driven by a desire to make a difference, I strive to develop groundbreaking pharmaceutical technologies with a focus on Research and Development costs and accessibility.
